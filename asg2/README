Project description: Write a translator for leet and English.


What I have done to augment the leet obfuscation is:

*Use Greek and Cyrillic characters to make the translation more beautiful.

*I use file Romeo as test case,Romeo_leet is the etol out put, Romeo_English is the ltoe out put.

*And run $ diff Romeo Romeo_English to  check if there any difference between them.

*To simpfy this asg, you can just run my.sh to get the results.

The easiest part of this project: I don't need to write a lot of code

Problems that I had in completing this project: Solve the duplicities and ambiguities
