Project description: python functions, scope, return value, relationnal operations, if/elif/else 

The easiest part of this project, including what language
construct was the easiest to implement: Based on project 4 the relationnal operations are not so difficult.

Problems that I had in completing this project:
It's difficult to keep track of those functions and variables, and also the return statement is difficult.
