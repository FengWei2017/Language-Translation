Project description: Compute python files complexity

What I have accomplished to implement McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity
Metric, including using the radon oracle:  

I test my program with the testcases which I downloaded from Internet, 
I can pass 75 in all 107. 
And if I run it with Python-2.7.2/Lib, the result is 31 passed and 173 failed.
Something I found interedting about Radon:
************************************************************************************
1. Radon's output is empty when the file's complexity is 0(such as 'hello world'); 
2. If a class a method and a function(not method function) have the same 
complexity. Radon sort them in this priority Class->Method(this class's)
and Fuction->Method, Fuction and Class has the same priority by my experience.
3. Radon use different Charaters to output the complexity, if the complexity is 
1-5 Radon uses A for 6-10 B and larger than 10 radon uses C. 
*************************************************************************************

The easiest part of this project, including what language
construct was the easiest to implement:  
The easiest part is to construct the form of the output, it's not difficult.

Problems that I had in completing this project, including what
Python language construct caused the most difficulty:  The hardest part of this program is to compute the complexity of class, it's really puzzling. Another difficult thing is to construct the grammar tree, I am not sure what statemets are the terminals, that relly anoying.
