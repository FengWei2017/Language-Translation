Project description: Design and implement an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to represent and interpret your Python code.

The easiest part of this project, including what language
construct was the easiest to implement: The basic operations for int and float are quite easy, such as + - */ . And % and // ** are a little bit difficult. 

Problems that I had in completing this project, including what
Python language construct caused the most difficultyi: The most difficult challenge in this projct is to slice strings. And there are also some interesti points about the value of index when slicing. Such as str[-1], and str[2,-1].

In general my solution could handle all the required operations for float and int. And for string, my solution could handle int*string  string*int string+string assign and slicing.
